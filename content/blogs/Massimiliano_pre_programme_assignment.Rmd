# Biography

Hello, my name is *Massimiliano* and I will be a MAM2022 student. I'm really excited and I look forward to meet my new classmates!

I've always lived in Treviso, a small city close to *Venice*, but during the last 3 years I've lived in Milan, where I achieved my Bachelor in Management Engineering.

During the last 3 years I had the possibility of visiting different countries, such as:
1. Israel
2. Orlando,Florida
3. London

I also joined an extraordinary community of young people from 18-21 years old called [Aurora Fellows](https://aurorafellows.com/).

Hope to be in UK as soon as possible and to live an extraordinary experience!
